## ADR-001: Use ECDSA Instead of RSA

**Date**: 2024-12-01
**Status**: Accepted

**Context**:
We needed to choose a default key algorithm for the PKI system. The main candidates were RSA and ECDSA.

**Decision**:
Use ECDSA (P-256 and P-384 curves) as the default key algorithm for all certificates, with RSA support as optional for legacy compatibility.

**Rationale**:
- **Performance**: ECDSA is significantly faster for signing operations
- **Key Size**: 256-bit ECDSA â‰ˆ 3072-bit RSA security, but much smaller
- **Modern**: Industry trend is moving toward ECDSA
- **TLS 1.3**: Better support for ECDSA
- **HSM**: Modern HSMs have excellent ECDSA support

**Consequences**:
- **Positive**: Faster operations, smaller certificates, lower bandwidth
- **Negative**: Some very old clients don't support ECDSA
- **Mitigation**: Maintain RSA support for legacy systems

## ADR-002: Microservices Architecture

**Date**: 2024-12-01
**Status**: Accepted

**Context**:
We needed to decide between a monolithic application or microservices for the PKI platform.

**Decision**:
Implement as microservices with each major function (CA, RA, OCSP, etc.) as a separate service.

**Rationale**:
- **Scalability**: Scale individual services independently (OCSP needs more instances than CA)
- **Security**: Isolation between components reduces blast radius
- **Development**: Teams can work independently on different services
- **Resilience**: Failure of one service doesn't bring down the entire system
- **Technology**: Can use different storage/tech for different services if needed

**Consequences**:
- **Positive**: Better scalability, security, and team autonomy
- **Negative**: More operational complexity, inter-service communication overhead
- **Mitigation**: Use Kubernetes for orchestration, implement service mesh for secure communication

## ADR-006: Offline Root CA

**Date**: 2024-12-01
**Status**: Accepted

**Context**:
Needed to decide whether the root CA should be online or offline.

**Decision**:
Root CA is **always offline**, stored on air-gapped systems. Only intermediate CAs are online.

**Rationale**:
- **Security**: Root CA compromise is catastrophic
- **Best Practice**: Industry standard (Let's Encrypt, DigiCert, etc. all do this)
- **Compliance**: Required for WebTrust and other certifications
- **Risk Reduction**: Minimize exposure of root key

**Consequences**:
- **Positive**: Maximum security for root CA
- **Negative**: Operational overhead for root CA operations (signing intermediates)
